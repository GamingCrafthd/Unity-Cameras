# Unity-Cameras

A repo where I'll be placing various camera controller scripts. These will probably all use the new input system but it should be easy enough to change the code to work with whatever you use for input.

## FreeMoveCamera.cs 

A Unity scene editor like camera. 
WASD movement (holding the RightMouseButton).
MiddelMouse or Ctrl+LeftMouse to pan.
Alt+LeftMouse to rotate around pivot point. This pivor could be the position of a focused transform.
ScrollWheel to zoom in/out.
Method to focus on a transform (like the F key in Unity).
